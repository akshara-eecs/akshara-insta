# Insta485 - a Social Media Project

## Overview

Insta485 is a social media platform developed as a comprehensive web development project. It showcases the transition from basic static web pages to sophisticated server-side and client-side dynamic functionalities, mirroring the evolution of modern web applications.

## Development Phases

### Static Pages
- The project began with the design and implementation of static HTML/CSS pages to prototype the platform's interface.
- These pages laid the foundation for the structure and aesthetics of the application.

### Server-Side Dynamic Pages
- Integrated Flask to convert static pages into dynamic ones, enabling personalized content rendering based on server-side logic.
- Implemented RESTful APIs to manage user data, posts, and interactions.
- Used Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering, ensuring content was dynamically generated for each user.

### Client-Side Dynamic Pages
- Enhanced interactivity with JavaScript and AJAX for seamless user experiences without full-page reloads.
- Leveraged APIs to enable client-side fetching and updating of data in real-time.
- Implemented features such as live likes, comments, and feed updates.
